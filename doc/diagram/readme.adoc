= Statediagram of the implemented FSM

This directory contains a http://mermaid.js.org/[Mermaid^] diagram of the FSA used by the parser for Semantic Versions.

== Viewing the diagram

You can view the diagram online in the live preview of Mermaid or by installing the Mermaid plugin for IntelliJ IDEA in the IDE directly.

== Updating the diagramm

Updating the diagram is only needed, if the implementation of the class `SemVerFiniteStateTransitionTable` has changed.

To update the diagram do the following:

1. Run the Python programm `extract-transitions.py` with Python 3.
2. Capture the output of the programm and use it to replace the current transitions in the diagram.
3. Set the style classes in the diagram
4. Edit the labels for the transistions and replace `TransitionCharSet.ofNegationFor` with an `!` as indicator or a negation and put the negated character classes in braces.
